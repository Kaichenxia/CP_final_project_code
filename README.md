-only useful for short term prediction; •Set up: 2D grid longer term may require time-series 

analysis

•States: Infected, healthy, 

recovered, dead, vaccinated -assumes scale invariance (follows 

immediately by using random walks) •Age group statistically distributed 

among population -only tracks ACTIVE infections

•Age group assigned infection risk factor
